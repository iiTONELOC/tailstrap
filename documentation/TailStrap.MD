# TailStrap

**_A component library for React.js + TailwindCSS_**

## Introduction

Tired of implementing boilerplate for buttons, tool-tips, modals, and toasts,
TailStrap aims to fill the gap in a reuseable component library plugin for TailwindCSS + React.js.  
TailStrap aims to be as light as possible and is designed to be integrated into your existing React + TailwindCSS projects

## Requirements

Make sure you have React.js and TailwindCSS installed prior to installation.

## Backward Compatibility

TailStrap was built using Tailwindcss 3.0.1 and should have no issues using v2 or later.  
In an effort to be as backward compatible as possible, most of our default classNames do not utilize changes in v3. TailStrap has been tested on v2.2.16 and 3.0.1

## Installation

```md
    npm i tailstrap
```
